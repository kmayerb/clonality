# clonality

Metrics for estimating repertoire clonality in Python coded with numpy as the only dependency

The goal of this package is three fold:

1. For a np.array of clonal frequencies or counts all of the following metrics can be quickly computed and tabulated in a single table 
2. Graphs can be produced that illustrate sensitivity of metrics to rare or common clones.
3. Compute collapsed Diversity Metrics and Repertoire Overlap Metrics


### Evenness Measures
1. Pielou's Evenness Index
2. Gini coefficient

### TODO: Entropy Based Diversity Indices 

1. Hill Numbers
2. Renyi entropy 
3. Shannon entropy
4. Gini-Simpson Index

#### TODO: Repertoire Overlap Measures
1. Jaccard indices
2. Sorenson index
3. Morisita-Horn Index

### TODO: Rep Fuzzy Overlap where Ni = Nj if Dist(i,j) < x

### TODO: Unit Tests
